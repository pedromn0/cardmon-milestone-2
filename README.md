# Cardmon Memory Game

The idea of this project is to practice the knowledge learned so far about the interactive frontend module of the Code Institute software development course.
 
In this module was presented the javascript main aspects, exercises and at the end of this module this project was created to put in practice the concepts learned at this point.
 
This project borned from my personal attraction for games such as Pokemon and my curiosity to understand a bit more of how they are made. Also I decided to build this memory game utilising Pokemon API and just vanilla javascript. In that way I practise how to interact with API and how to construct the logic of this game practising the fundamental parts of javascript as the interaction with array and objects, manipulation of the DOM, event listers and some lops.

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### User Stories


### Framework


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

### Notable Bugs
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

For deploy this project I utilised some of the mentioned technologies above to facilated this process.

1. The first step were created a repository on GitHub with the name **cardmon-milestone-2**
2. Installed the **Gitpod** extension for **Google Chrome**;
3. Linked **Gitpod** gaving **access** to my **GitHub profile** with my login and password;
4. After that all repositories started to showed the **Gitpod button** just next to the button Code.
5. Clicking in the **Gitpod button** you have access to the code editor linked with this repository.
6. After editing the code it was possibble utilising **Git command** (status, add, commit and push) in the **terminal** updated Github repository.
7. To deploy was necessary went to repository settings and scrolled down untill the options Github pages **check it out here!**
8. In the link it was necessary went to option **source** and selected the main branch
9. After that I clicked on the button **save**.
10. Finally after those steps the link of the webiste was ready to be utilised and the project is live.
